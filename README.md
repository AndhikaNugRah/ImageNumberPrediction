# ImageNumberPrediction
Project Description:

The project involves developing a system that can recognize handwritten digits from images captured using a camera. The system will be trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) with a size of 28x28 pixels.

System Components:

Image Acquisition: The system will use a camera to capture images of handwritten digits. These images will be preprocessed to enhance quality and remove noise.

Image Preprocessing: The captured images will be resized to 28x28 pixels, and then normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1.

Feature Extraction: The preprocessed images will be fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features. The CNN will learn to identify patterns in the images that are relevant for digit recognition.

Model Training: The extracted features will be used to train a deep learning model using the MNIST dataset. The model will learn to recognize patterns in the images and associate them with the corresponding digits.

Note:

Image Quality: The quality of the captured images may vary depending on the camera and lighting conditions. This can affect the performance of the system.

Variability in Handwriting: Handwritten digits can vary significantly in terms of shape, size, and orientation. This can make it challenging for the
